              Hi there! Thank you for visiting my site 😊. 
              I'm currently pursuing a <span style={{color: '#3dace3'}}>B.S. in Computer Science </span> 
              at Rutgers University as well as a <span style={{color: '#3eab85'}}>Biology minor</span> for fun. 
          </Box>
          
          <Box fontWeight="fontWeightLight" fontSize="h5.fontSize" mt={2}>
            Ever since I was young, I was interested in a variety of subjects: art, biology, chemistry, etc. 
            When I discovered computer science in my freshman year of college, I was amazed at how versatile the tech industry was.
            I could combine my passion for art in my frontend designs, my interest in research with data science,
            and bring abstract ideas to life by building concrete projects!

            As the Design Director of <span style={{color: '#cc0033'}}>HackRU</span> (our school's biannual hackathon) 
            and the Vice President of the <span style={{color: '#cc0033'}}>RU Mobile App Development Club</span>, 
            I've gotten the awesome chance to help students foster their own love for coding.
